# Workshop: ‘Unlocking Quantitative Historical Text Data: From the Archives to Analysis’, Marta Pagnini (19, 20, 21 November 2025)

This workshop introduces social science researchers to the collection, processing, and analysis of historical text data. Over three sessions, each lasting 3 hours, participants will gain both conceptual foundations and hands-on experience in R and Python (no prior coding required). Each session combines 90 minutes of lecture with 90 minutes of guided practice in R and Python, ensuring participants leave with reproducible scripts and workflows.
Drawing on my own research experience, I will guide students through the entire process - from raw data to analysis. 

I constructed a longitudinal database based on entries from the Court Circular, the official record of royal engagements of the British royal family which, after being approved directly by the British monarch, has been published daily in national newspapers from 1803 to today. For this project, I web-scraped more than 23,000 images of the Court Circular from The Times (1870–1949) and extracted over 150,000 records of royal events using a combination of web scraping, OCR, and machine learning techniques. The resulting dataset includes information on who the royals interacted with (over 300,000 interactions with non-royal individuals), the types of events, and where they took place (more than 160,000 distinct locations across Britain).
• Session 1 focuses on data collection and data cleaning. We will cover strategies for locating and acquiring historical corpora through digital archives, web scraping, and OCR techniques. The session also addresses how to structure large-scale historical text data, with emphasis on cleaning messy texts and segmenting corpora.
• Session 2 addresses information extraction. We will use regular expressions, dictionary methods, and named entity recognition (NER) models to extract persons, organizations, and locations from textual data.
• Session 3 explores how to interpret extracted data. Topics include categorizing information with text classification models, as well as applying analytical methods to historical text datasets. The session concludes with an example of transforming spatial information into data visible on a map, linking locations to country, region, and county levels.

By the end of the workshop, participants will be equipped with both methodological insights and practical tools for applying historical text analysis in their own social science research.
Practical information

Sessions will take place on 19 November (16:00 – 19:00), 20 November (10:00 – 13:00), 21 November (10:00 - 13:00). A laptop is required. It is recommended to install beforehand both R here, R studio here, and Pycharm here.
