His gallant leadership undoubtedly saved the situation and kept intact the right flank . on which depended the success of the operations and the safety of the troops in rear . In the subsequent withdrawal , re cognizing that a diversion was necessary to enable the withdrawal of the company , which was impeded by their wounded , with a handful of his men he turned back and counter - attacked the pursuing enemy , and , with the rest of his party , was killed fighting to the last .
